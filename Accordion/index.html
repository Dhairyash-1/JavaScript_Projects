            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
            is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside
            HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the
            client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party
            libraries.

            Array methods are functions built-in to JavaScript that we can apply
            to our arrays Each method has a unique function that performs a
            change or calculation to our array and saves us from writing common
            functions from scratch.

            When JavaScript executes within a web browser it is operating within
            the browser's runtime environment. The browser runtime environment
            provides access to the DOM which enables interaction with web page
            elements, handling events, and manipulating the page structure.

            An Object is a unique entity that contains properties and methods.
            For example “a car” is a real-life Object, which has some
            characteristics like color, type, model, and horsepower and performs
            certain actions like driving. The characteristics of an Object are
            called Properties in Object-Oriented Programming and the actions are
            called methods. An Object is an instance of a class. Objects are
            everywhere in JavaScript, almost every element is an Object whether
            it is a function, array, or string.
